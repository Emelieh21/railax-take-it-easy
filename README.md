# Railax: Bringing Peace to Your Journey

### Description

Sometimes, you want to enjoy a quit trip, and get some work done - or just have a siesta. But suddenly, it turns out a bunch that a bunch of noisy people jump in the train, and your peace is gone. The weekly football match attract all hooligans to the train. Wouldn't it be nice to know in advance what to expect from your trip? 

_This project is a result of the DB Mindbox Hackathon Berlin 12-13 May of 2017._
